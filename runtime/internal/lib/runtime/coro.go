// A coro represents extra concurrency without extra parallelism,
// as would be needed for a coroutine implementation.
// The coro does not represent a specific coroutine, only the ability
// to do coroutine-style control transfers.
// It can be thought of as like a special channel that always has
// a goroutine blocked on it. If another goroutine calls coroswitch(c),
// the caller becomes the goroutine blocked in c, and the goroutine
// formerly blocked in c starts running.
// These switches continue until a call to coroexit(c),
// which ends the use of the coro by releasing the blocked
// goroutine in c and exiting the current goroutine.
//
// Coros are heap allocated and garbage collected, so that user code
// can hold a pointer to a coro without causing potential dangling
// pointer errors.
